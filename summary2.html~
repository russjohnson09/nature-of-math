Book II explored what we now call "geometric algebra." That is, it
framed in geometric terms certain relationships that now are most easily
translated into algebraic equations . Of course, the notion of algebra was
foreign to the Greeks, and its appearance as a formal system lay centuries
in the future.

<p>
PROPOSITION 11.4 If a straight line be cut at random, the square on the
whole is equal to the squares on the segments and twice the rectangle
contained by the segments.
</p>

<p>
This is written more simply as $(a + b)^2= a^2 +b^2 + 2 ab = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$.
</p>

<p>
Yet the equivalence of his geo­metric statement and its algebraic counterpart is clear. Much of Book I I
was o f this nature .
</p>

<p>
nor did Book I I I contain the familiar results for a cirde's circumference
$( C = \pi D)$ or area $(A = \pi r^2)$ . A full treatment of these latter topics would have to wait
until Archamedias.

<p>
In fact, while Euclid did not explicitly say so, most subsequent mathe­
maticians assumed that his were the only constructible regular polygons
and that any others were simply beyond the capability of compass and
straightedge.
</p>

<p>
It was thus a shock of monumental proportions when the teenaged
Carl Friedrich Gauss discovered how to construct a regular heptadeca­
gon ( 17-gon) in 1796.

<p>
Similar rectilineal figures are such as have their angles
severally equal and the sides about the equal angles proportional .
</p>

<p>
Making use of the Eudox­
ean theory of Book V, Euclid proved, in Proposition VI .4, that if two tri­
angles have their corresponding angles equal, then their corresponding
sides must be proportional ; conversely, in Proposition V1 . 5 , he showed
that if two triangles have their sides proportional, then their correspond­
ing angles must be equal .
</p>

<p>
If in a right-angled triangle a perpendicular be drawn
from the right angle to the base, the triangles adjoining the perpendic­
ular are similar both to the whole and to one another.
</p>

<p>
A critical definition was that of a prime number, that is,
a number greater than 1 that is divisible by (Euclid said, "measured by")
only 1 and itself.
</p>

<p>
Further, Euclid defined a perJect number to be one which is the sum
of its "parts" -that is, its proper divisors. Thus, the number 6 is perfect
since its proper divisors are 1 , 2 , and 3 (we exclude 6 as a divisor of
itself, since we want only proper divisors) , and clearly 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
</p>

<p>
It is clear that Euclid's algorithm has concrete applications and is
entirely automatic. It requires no particular insight or ingenuity to deter­
mine the greatest common divisor of a pair of numbers; indeed, a com­
puter can easily be programmed to carry out the process.
</p>

<p>
Any composite number is measured by [that is, divis­
ible by] some prime number.
</p>

If a number b e the least that i s measured by prime
numbers, it will not be measured by any other prime number except
those originally measuring it.

Today we call this the
"unique factorization theorem" or alternately the "fundamental theorem
of arithmetic ."

Prime numbers are more than any assigned multi­tude of prime numbers.

If as many numbers as we please beginning from a
unit be set out continuously in double proportion, until the sum of all
becomes prime , and if the sum multiplied into the last make some num­
ber, the product will be perfect.

Such primes, like 7 and 31, are today called "Mersenne primes," in honor of the French Father Marin Mersenne (1588- 1648),
who discussed them in a 1644 paper. Because of their link to perfect
numbers, Mersenne primes hold a particular fascination for number the­
orists even to the present day.


If an area be contained by a rational straight line and
a sixth apotome, the side of the area is a straight line which produces
with a medial area a medial whole.


PROPOSmON X.96
If an area be contained by a rational straight line and
a sixth apotome, the side of the area is a straight line which produces
with a medial area a medial whole.


PROPOSmON XIUO
Any cone is a third part of the cylinder which has
the same base with it and equal height (Figure 3 .7) .

PROPOsmON xn.2 Circles are to one another as the squares on their
diameters.

A regular solid is one all of whose plane faces are congruent, regular
polygons.
These aesthetically pleasing solids, shown in Figure 3 .8, were fea­
tured prominently in Plato's Timaeus from around 350 B.C. There Plato
considered, among other things, the nature of the four "elements"
thought to compose the world-fire, air, water, and earth. It was clear,
said Plato, that these four elements are bodies and that all bodies are
solids.


To summarize, Euclid had shown that there can be no more than five
regular solids-three with equilateral triangles as faces and one each
with squares and regular pentagons as faces. No amount of effort or inge­
nuity will produce any more of these remarkable figures.


Sir Thomas Heath, who put it sim­
ply, directly, and accurately: The Elements " . . . is and will doubtless
remain the greatest mathematical textbook of all times . "
