Book I I explored what we now call "geometric algebra." That is, it
framed in geometric terms certain relationships that now are most easily
translated into algebraic equations . Of course, the notion of algebra was
foreign to the Greeks, and its appearance as a formal system lay centuries
in the future.

PROPOSITION 11.4 If a straight line be cut at random, the square on the
whole is equal to the squares on the segments and twice the rectangle
contained by the segments .

This is written more simply as $(a + b)^2= a^2 +b^2 + 2 ab = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$

Yet the equivalence of his geo­metric statement and its algebraic counterpart is clear. Much of Book I I
was o f this nature .


nor did Book I I I contain the familiar results for a cirde's circumference
$( C = \pi D)$ or area $(A = \pi r^2)$ . A full treatment of these latter topics would have to wait
until Archamedias.


In fact, while Euclid did not explicitly say so, most subsequent mathe­
maticians assumed that his were the only constructible regular polygons
and that any others were simply beyond the capability of compass and
straightedge.


It was thus a shock of monumental proportions when the teenaged
Carl Friedrich Gauss discovered how to construct a regular heptadeca­
gon ( 17-gon) in 1796.

Similar rectilineal figures are such as have their angles
severally equal and the sides about the equal angles proportional .

Making use of the Eudox­
ean theory of Book V, Euclid proved, in Proposition VI .4, that if two tri­
angles have their corresponding angles equal, then their corresponding
sides must be proportional ; conversely, in Proposition V1 . 5 , he showed
that if two triangles have their sides proportional, then their correspond­
ing angles must be equal .

If in a right-angled triangle a perpendicular be drawn
from the right angle to the base, the triangles adjoining the perpendic­
ular are similar both to the whole and to one another.

A critical definition was that of a prime number, that is,
a number greater than 1 that is divisible by (Euclid said, "measured by")
only 1 and itself.
